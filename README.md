### Hi there 👋


🚀 Senior Software Engineer | Advanced AI & Backend Architect | 9+ Years Experience. 

I specialize in building AI-powered Backend Systems and Agentic Architectures that solve complex problems at scale. With 25,000+ hours of hands-on experience, I design and deploy high-availability platforms that blend cutting-edge AI (LLMs, RAG, MCP) with robust, scalable backend infrastructure for startups and enterprises.

💡 EU-Authorized & Global-Ready 
I operate through an Estonian e-Residency company (EU-registered) and a US LLC, fully compliant with EU & US contracting, VAT, and GDPR frameworks. This enables smooth B2B collaboration with startups and enterprises worldwide — no sponsorship required.

AI & Agentic Systems:
- Multi-agent orchestration (LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, CrewAI)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector DBs (PGVector, Pinecone, Chroma)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless tool/data integration
- LLMs: OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, self-hosted
- Prompt engineering, workflow automation, multi-modal, and corrective RAG
- AI analytics: Langfuse, LangSmith, synthetic data pipelines

Backend & Cloud:
- Languages: Python, Java, Node.js, TypeScript, PHP
- Frameworks: Spring Boot, FastAPI, Django, Flask, Express, Celery
- APIs: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, Swagger/OpenAPI
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, Firebase
- Messaging: RabbitMQ, Google Pub/Sub, Kafka
- Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, API Gateway), GCP (GKE, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, BigQuery), Serverless
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD (CircleCI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions), Ansible
- MicroServices, event-driven architecture, scalable API gateways

Key Achievements:
- Led design and deployment of agentic RAG and MCP
-based backends for millions of requests with 99.9% uptime
- Developed multi-agent orchestration frameworks for dynamic task delegation and self-healing AI pipelines
- Integrated OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and DeepSeek models for intelligent recommendations, boosting engagement by 35%
- Built secure, scalable APIs (REST/GraphQL) and reduced integration times by 40%
- Migrated legacy systems to cloud-native (AWS/GCP), cutting costs by 30%
- Optimized Elasticsearch for 50% faster queries and higher conversion rates

Industries:
Applied AI, IP Law, SaaS, FinTech, IoT, E-commerce, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, ERP, Data Analytics
