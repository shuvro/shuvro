### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a self-motivated and diligent computer programmer who finds that the best way to come up with solutions is to think outside the box. I believe that when it comes to programming work, itâ€™s equal parts creativity and logic.

I have found that being a positive, disciplined, and effective communicator I am able to not only get through any challenge, but Iâ€™m able to evoke the same measure of resilience from those around me.

To an extent, I specialize in large scale, high availability enterprise applications development (Web and Desktop) and an agile and ambitious software engineer with a strong technical background who possesses self-discipline, hardworking, quick learning, good team spirit and honesty.

That is how I have managed to work over 16,000 hours (6+ Years) in my Software Development timeframe.
