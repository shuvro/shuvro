### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a self-motivated and diligent computer programmer who finds that the best way to come up with solutions is to think outside the box. I believe that when it comes to programming work, it's equal parts creativity and logic.

I have found that being a positive, disciplined, and effective communicator, I cannot only get through any challenge but Iâ€™m ableI'm evoke the same measure of resilience from those around me.

To an extent, I specialize in large-scale, high-availability enterprise applications development (Web and Desktop) and am an agile and ambitious software engineer with a solid technical background who possesses self-discipline, hard work, quick learning, good team spirit, and honesty.

That is how I have managed to work over 21,000 hours (8+ Years) in my Software Development timeframe.
